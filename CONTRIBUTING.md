Thank you for even consider to help, if you are wondering how to collaborate here are some tips.

#Guidelines

1. Please create commits as simple as possible with descriptive messages
2. Use pull request system, be very descriptive on the new bug/functionality that you are trying to achieve
3. Add tests at a rational level (happy path, corner cases, per bugfix)
4. Try to follow current code conventions
